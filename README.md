# Zomata-Rating-Prediction
To predict the performance of a restaurant in the future, so that Zomato can include it on their app
Zomato has shared the data of 9551 restaurants from all over the world which are currently present in the Zomato App. It contains the details about the restaurants and what rating it achieved finally.

The task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the Rating of a restaurant based on its characteristics

The flow of the case study is as below:

* Reading the data in python
* Defining the problem statement
* Identifying the Target variable
* Looking at the distribution of Target variable
* Basic Data exploration
* Feature Engineering
* Rejecting useless columns
* Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
* Feature Selection based on data distribution
* Outlier treatment
* Missing Values treatment
* Visual correlation analysis
* Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
* Converting data to numeric for ML
* Sampling and K-fold cross validation
* Trying multiple Regression algorithms
* Selecting the best Model
* Deploying the best model in production

The data has one file "ZomatoData.csv". This file contains 9551 restaurants details.
